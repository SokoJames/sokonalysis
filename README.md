###### The Cipher Toolkit Build For All Skill Levels 

## About
sokonalysis from the word cryptanalysis is a cryptographic tool developed by Soko James and it seeks to decrypt encrypted messages or break cryptographic systems with or without the secret key. Meant for University Students, Capture The Flag (CTF) competitions and Organizations to apply cryptography as a field.

## Requirements
The file named **wordlist.txt** is needed for local wordlist for the hashing algorithms md5, sha1 and sha256 but if you wish to customize it, add your own text in the same text file and keep it in the same folder as the tool.

## Collaborator 
For every git clone command on the download option, use these commands below if you have access to the repository.

````bash
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your-email@example.com"
````
````bash
cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
````
1. Copy the full output (starts with ssh-ed25519).
2. Go to GitHub → Settings → SSH and GPG keys
3. Click “New SSH key”
4. Paste the public key
5. Give it a title (e.g., "sokonalysis SSH")
6. Click “Add SSH key”

````bash
ssh -T git@github.com
````
````bash
git clone git@github.com:sokonalysis/sokonalysis.git

1. ## University Level
   University students taking Cryptography as a course can utilize option 1 – 4 to automate their work. You don’t need internet connection (except options involving APIs or external websites) to perform these tasks but just some questions you can utilize. This tool will act as an offline calculator to verify the answers after a student 
solves a question manually.
   Lets take an RSA example from Kapasa Makasa University CYS110 2025 Test 1;
   
   a) You have received a message UTLAIKNP encrypted with the key (33,7). Find the private keys that should be used to decrypt the message and work out the clear text.

   `STEP 1` <br>
   Utilize option 8 to check the help menu and try to understand the RSA algorithm.

   <img width="798" height="572" alt="Image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/27a61ad7-6edb-4d9d-a3f9-d1dbba8ec67c" />

   `STEP 2` <br>
   Based on the encryption key given (33,7), we can conclude to say that the Public Key (n,e) is n = 33 and e = 7. Now, we compute n we get the product of p and q, for which they are two large prime numbers such as 11 and 3 which gives us 33. Let's now proceed to the RSA algorithm by selecting option 2.

   <img width="801" height="656" alt="Image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/debf131e-9541-446d-b755-931431f1a5a5" />

   `STEP 3` <br>
   Now, let's assume as if we are encrypting a message with the given Public Key (33,7) so that we can retrive the Private Key (n,d).

   <img width="796" height="197" alt="Image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b71ce952-55c6-4d20-93dd-fc96083e2583" />

   `STEP 4` <br>
   There we go, we've obtained the Private Key (33,3). Restart the program, welcome back!!! Let's utilize option 4 to convert the cipher text letters to numbers because the program can only decryp numerical values.

   <img width="796" height="654" alt="Image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0a4d12e4-78ca-412c-88e8-9bc8c9ebd2e3" />

   `STEP 5` <br>
   At this point we can decode the given cipher text by following the previsious steps but selecting the decryption option.

3. ## CTF Level
   Cryptography is a popular category in most Capture The Flag platforms like [Hack The Box (HTB)](https://account.hackthebox.com/login), [PicoCTF](https://play.picoctf.org/), [CyberTalents](https://cybertalents.com/) etc.. sokonalysis can be used to solve these challenges, but with v2.2 only few algorithms are working. sokonalysis will also provide a framework that will link the user to all popular Cryptographic tools used for CTF, thereby reducing the time of finding the right tools to use.

   <img width="800" height="425" alt="Image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9423dd1c-03d8-4ecd-8ecc-2de091b61ecf" />

    Let’s jump into these challenges!!!

   ### [No Padding, no problem](https://play.picoctf.org/practice/challenge/154?category=2&page=3&search=) <br>
   `STEP 1` <br>
   Connect to the challenge server with the command nc mercury.picoctf.net 42248 in Linux or ncat mercury.picoctf.net 42248 on Windows CMD if you have Nmap - Zenmap GUI installed.

   `STEP 2` <br>
   Select option 1 to view RSA options.

   `STEP 3` <br>
   Select option 13 and enter the given values for n, e and c.

   <img width="801" height="639" alt="Image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8de9aa23-db27-432a-aff8-962cf44cdb40" />

   `STEP 4` <br>
   Give the server the modified cipher text to decrypt.

   `STEP 5` <br>
   Finally, decrypt the cipher to get the flag with the new cipher text from the server.
